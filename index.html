    <h1>1. What have you done so far?</h1>
    <p>
      So far, we have built the initial prototype of our interactive web
      visualization using D3.js and published it through GitHub Pages. We’ve
      implemented a heatmap in the shape of a keyboard that compares frequencies
      of which keys are pressed between individuals with Parkinson’s Disease and
      the control group. For each key on the keyboard, the heatmap shows how
      frequently that key is pressed across both groups. This allows viewers to
      spot patterns and differences. In addition, we have a toggle feature that
      lets users switch between viewing the Parkinson's heatmap and the control
      group heatmap.

      2. What will be the most challenging part of your project to design and
      why?
    </h1>
    <p>
      The most challenging part of our project will be developing the live
      typing interface that compares a user’s real-time typing patterns to the
      patterns in the dataset. This means we have to capture keystroke events in
      the browser and sync them with visual updates in real time. We’ll also
      need to handle edge cases like backspaces and special keys while making
      sure the performance stays smooth across different devices. Furthermore,
      we’ll also need to design the interface so that the comparisons are clear
      without overwhelming the user.
